                            <p> My Latitude E6430 just updated to the latest Windows 10 version last night. My display adapter had a driver issue. I downloaded a new driver from DELL 3 times. Same Issue I went to the Intel site and tried downloading it. Intel tells me to go to Dell because it must come from my hardware provider. I chatted with Dell and they want to charge me over 0 to help me figure out why their driver doesn't work on their equipment (no new hardware) with their driver. The error I am getting is:"Th. 
When I disable the driver they launch and load until the loading screen and return an error that the graphic card has been removed. When I launch them with the driver enabled, they show a black screen for a while and then crash. I have the latest driver installed, how do I fix this?. CPU: Intel i7 3770k MoBo: Asus P8Z77-V LK GPU: EVGA GTX 660 OS: Windows 8.1 It's been a month since I've reformatted my computer, and it's been running pretty much fine since then. I did notice that the fans get a little louder than they usually when playing FIFA, which is when I noticed that I don't see my integrated graphics card in device manager. I tried downloading the latest drivers from Intel, but the installer gives me an error saying that my computer does not meet the minimum requir. Operating System ================== Windows 10 Computer Specs (PSU, GPU, CPU, RAM, Motherboard) ================== PC built into a Totevision TV - Intel HD Graphics 4000 driver Speccy Link ================== N/A Description of problem ================== This came as a combo where the computer is built into the television. At some point, the computer stopped recognizing that the TV was there at all. I could work around it by plugging a vga cable in from the pc to the tv, but then touchscreen. Hey, My laptop is no longer picking up HDMI. It was working before, recently bought a longer cable and it was working fine yesterday. I plug it in and the TV just says 'no signal'. Laptop doesn't see it (Windows 10) being plugged in. There are no errors under device manager. I have updated the Nvidia GT650M driver and the Intel HD Graphics 4000 driver but that didn't work. Tried using Windows + P but all it does is connect to a non exisiting screen for some reason. It shouldn't be the cable. I have a triple monitor set up at work. I upgraded to windows 10, and the Intel HD Graphics 4000 driver updated along with it. I am now only able to get two displays working at a time. Two monitors are connected via DP to HDMI cables and the third is straight VGA. Intel's support is telling me that I have to use straight HDMI or straight DP not combo cables or the system won't support three monitors. I know this is more of a PC tech support question, but I was hoping to get some advice.

Hey guys. I just got my laptop back from repairs and I am having problems. Every time I install the drivers for my GTX 970M, the installation finishes and then the screen freezes in place until I hold down the power to shut the system off. I've tried different versions of the driver from NVIDIA, from Windows Update, and from Sager. All of them do this. I also tried an older version of the Intel HD Graphics 4000 driver. I even tried reinstalling Windows. My OS is Windows 
I've been trying to get Windows 10 on my PC since it got out but every time I get the same problem: each time the Windows Update finds out my video card installs its driver. Windows asks to restart to finish the update when rebooting the BSOD appears (VIDEO_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT_INTERNAL error). The only way to log in is in Safe Mode where I have to delete the NVidia driver from Device ManagergtDisplay Adapters (leaving the Intel HD Graphics 4000 driver alone) and uninstall all NVidia programs. Inspiron 5520 Intel Core i7-3612QM @ 2.10 GHz (8CPUs) 8GB RAM Windows 7-Home Premium 64-bit - Downloaded Fo4 - Wouldn't start - Issues ensued, full system restore in order - Newly restored, download Steam, chrome, Fo4 - Updated to latest Intel HD Graphics 4000 driver via Dell website (Intels site files wouldn't work for some reason) - Updated a bunch of other drivers I could while I was at it and restarted. - Nothing, Attempted every variant of screen resolution, windowed, border less, editing. Im having trouble running StarMade on the surface pro. I've updated the intel graphics driver as it was suggested but it still won't run. Has anyone run into this problem? Graphics card: Intel hd graphics 4000 driver version 9.17.10.3062 (which windows tells me is the newest) Edit: ~~it turns out my graphics card doesn't support open gl 2.1 so it can't run starmade~~. I spent all weekend, and literally 16 hours yesterday attempting to update my Acer Aspire 7600u all-in-one to Windows 10. I finally have it in a workable (but not ideal) state; and I'm not too sure how long it will last. But for my own records and other 7600u owners (I saw one or two while i was reading this subreddit for hours), here are the steps that I think made it all work. These are not the order of steps I took, but what is probably most logical. Errors These are some of the errors. Thanks for looking at this topic-- you've already done more to help than Lenovo.I'll try to include all the information I possibly can. Problem: Whenever I try to use the discrete graphics card (even for something like Firefox) it lags immensely for a few seconds before crashing and displaying the error message: "Display driver stopped responding and has recovered." Unfortunately, it never recovers and I have to shut down my laptop via power button because the screen's frozen. Extra Info:. 
I have three monitors, two of them use DVI/HDMI, but the other one is an old Dell 4:3 monitor that only has VGA. I used to have a GTX 770, which has 2 DVI and 1 HDMI connection. To use the monitor with VGA I used a VGA/DVI adapter, so I could connect it to one of the DVI ports. However, today I received a 1070 kindly given to me by a friend, and that only has 1 DVI port, which I use for my 2nd monitor, and nowhere to connect the VGA monitor. To still use it I connected the VGA monitor My 17" Dell Studio 1737 has an intel gpu but after installing 10074 build I just get a generic driver from MS and downloading the latest driver from Intel isnt installed on anything past 8.1. I tried following THIS ( link but when I get to select the inf to install it says there is no compatible hardware. I am always trying to find answers for my problems with Google, but this time I give up. I've read almost every topic on every discussion board, blog posts etc. about my problem. I've tried many tips, but nothing seems to work. I've even changed Linux distribution from Ubuntu to Mint, nothing. I'm trying to install drivers for my hybrid graphic card. Right now I have default drivers (xserver-xorg-video-ati) but there is major problem with that. When I'm trying to open few tabs in my browser. Every time i start Overwatch i get this strange error ( I use my GeForce GT 730m to run the game. The game itself remains to show a blackscreen and wont start until i pressed "OK" or "X" which makes it very annoying. I tried different things already like: Manually choose the GeForce Graphics Card in the Nvidia settings Updating my Intel Graphics card (what did'nt worked out because there are no newer drivers for my Notebook on the acer website) Every I have the asus X75A with windows 10 and intel HD 4000 graphics. I have been looking for hours to find the latest drivers, but I still get errors from multiple programs preventing me from using them due to outdated drivers. I can post whatever info you need to help me, thanks a lot for reading. Hi everyone! I'm experiencing blur effects with Windows 10 and the only way to make it go away is if I make the DPI settings at 100% instead of 125%. Even though there's no more blur at 100%, everything on my screen looks tiny for the most part and hard to see. To get to the point, apparently there's a beta version out for the driver for windows 10, but the page won't provide a direct link to install it. It says it is available to install through Windows Update, but windows update doesn't. Hey Guys I've had some graphical issues with battlefield 4 on my laptop. I have the AMD Radeon HD 7970M as main grahpic card and a Intel 4000 HD as supportive, to run minor programs, however the thing is, that i need a driver that can make these too work together, (at least thats what AMD says), So anyone that can recommend a specific driver that will help my computer run battlefield 4 more smoothly? Thank. 
hello, I'm on a Notebook with Windows 8.1 x64, an i7-3630QM and a Nvidia GTX 675MX/Intel HD 4000 (for windows applications). When I run with the normal windows drivers my HD 4000 is fast enough to handle normal desktop processes, but the windows driver gave me bluescreeens (IRQL not less or equal igdkm64.sys) so I updated to the newest Intel driver for the HD4000 and now it seems to be prettty slow. chrome lags and when I try to watch pictures on the internet its just not as responsive Disclaimer: I mention Turing, Pascal and Maxwell to help educate users on what versions of MacOs they're supported on but if you accidentally fell on this page thinking your RTX 2080ti is supported, please read carefully amp#x200B; amp#x200B; Hyperlinks to specific sections: AMD GPUs Native nVidia GPUs Unsupported nVidia GPUs Intel's Integrated Graphics AMD integrated Graphics(Work in progress) Recommend GPUs amp#x200B; So on this sub there’s been quite Good day, I have a windows 10 system with the following basic specs: Operating System: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (10.0, Build 17134) Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770K CPU @ 3.50GHz (8 CPUs), ~3.9GHz Memory: 16384MB RAM DirectX Version: DirectX 12 Card name: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Description: Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio) Ive got intel audio and motherboard chipsets.
