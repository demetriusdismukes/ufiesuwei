                            <p> When I finish the ticket reservation process that I've done 5-6 times before with "relative" ease. now on the last step when processing it says that my app is out of date, and i need to update the app to continue (Android). Google Play Store won't let me update the app further, last update was only 2 weeks ago on April 11th. So I'm pretty sure it's up to date. Anyone else experiencing this? Has anyone else been able to successfully get tickets in Canada So I just finished ending A and I went from really liking the game in the first hour, to hating it for the next 14, to really liking it in the last two hours. I'm gonna go out on a limb that the next few playthroughs will only get better, which is nice because right now I"m at about a 6.5 or 7 /10, 7 being a game worth playing for those who like the genre / developer team. I will say that the main reasons for my roller coaster is that the open world serves very little purpose 
I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed the game. The story is very cliche but I enjoyed it for what it was. The gameplay is what I imagined Final Fantasy Tactics would be if it was made today gameplay-wise. Are there any other games similar to this beside Really happy with this extension honestly! And very surprised. It was better than I expected. Finished baldur's gate 1 a lot of time. Baldur's gate 2 one time and I start a baldur's gate 2 again with my blade character from Sod. I enjoyed a lot new items especially for bards and story too. Just want to share my happiness üòÅü§ó. It looks like Android will be completed first. I wanted to ask any devs with dual releases, what their experience has been. And if there's any advantage in releasing together on the same day, or separately. Thanks. 
So I just finished route C, picking A2 and I'll be honest I'm a bit confused with what is going on. I wanted to find some sort of summary and explanation without spoiling myself with what it's left to be played. I just have some questions regarding the overall plot. Thanks. # Power Through One Last Thing Hey everyone, we're back again with one last day before the weekend. I was far less productive than I hoped but it wasn't as bad as it could have been. Like me you probably have a few things you'd like to wrap up today. So, let's all get something finished together! --- gt Instant gratification takes too long. gt ‚Äî Carrie Fisher --- Here's the plan: - Tell us something you want to get done today.

"Oh it's the latest cannabis beer infused with just the right amount of psychedelics."The scientist I must say outperform expectations every time."Said Kenny. They sure do. One hell of a New Year's ahead of us. Can you imagine it's been almost half a century since world peace was Achieved."stop it"said Kenny "Enough with the politics you always get like this just enjoy the high".But I can't. That's what happens when millions of stoners get involved. </p>
