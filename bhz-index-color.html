                            <p> I have a file i converted to index mode and prefer the color and dithering over any other mode. when i switch to RBG it drastically changes the look of my image. Id like to edit in this mode or figure out how to simulate it. Plus i cant save it as a JPG in this mode either. Any way around. I have an image, it's less than 256 colors, and I can't seem to be able to convert it from the imported full color to an index color palette. My exact steps are. Copy pixel art from photoshop. Create palette from current sprite (results in 240 colors). Change color mode to indexed (results in 230 colors). Now at this point I would expect nothing in the image to have changed since conversion to index should have all of the colors it needs, the palette is taken from the image itself Looking to print something photorealistic. The amount of layers or screens isn't a huge factor in that I am not in a business setting or looking at large productions. Just one print, w maybe 50 to 100 editions on black paper. Any advice on index seperations vs process seperations? Ive read that index can give you a really nice result if you can fit the image within the limits. 
Hi all, I have a question about working with images in Index Color. In the older versions of photoshop, you could load up Index Color mode, pick a few colors, and start filling in your designs using a limited palette. I used to work in commercial fabric with very limited color, usually between 6-12 colors. Now, Photoshop CC won't let you edit in index color anymore. The problem is, switching between RGB/Index Color causes Photoshop to "approximate" colors which causes tiny pixels to migrat. Have you guys ever tried using those shaders? https://github.com/lachlanmcdonald/magicavoxel-shaders/blob/master/README.md They are really cool and can help you build models faster. Some of the commands (Xnoise for example) require you to enter the "index color". I've tried to understand what this index is about but cannot make sense out of it. Sorry for the lack of details I'm writing this from my phone. If anyone can help I'd be delighted :) Cheers. In other words, is there a way to convert a single layer to Index Color? If that's not possible a workaround would be appreciated, this would really improve my workflow. Thanks in advance. I am working in Autocad Lt 2015. I would like to change the default hatch pattern to solid as I use that pattern 99% of the time. I have googled a ton and someone found a way to change it through the .pat file but it's vague. As long as I am in the same sheet once I change to hatch type to solid, it will continue coming up as solid but it's the initial hatch pop up on a new page that is set to ANS131 default I would like to change. I switch pages often. Also I would like to add 4 colors My question is I am using an array to populate a drop down menu with working code below. I am having trouble understanding why you need to use a +1 and a -1 in the code below. Removing the (+1/-1) I noticed when selecting the first value of 'blue' nothing comes in the display. However the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th work fine. Can someone explain why you need to use +1/-1 in the example code? Working code below: ltformgt lt?php function get ($name) { return isset ($_REQUEST. 
I have a string (GIIPIFGTANYAQKFQG). I need to highlight a certain index with html, but there might be multiple indexes. Here is the code I have so far def highlightLetter(str, index, color): htmlColor = 'ltfont color="{Color}"gt{Letter}lt/fontgt' strStart = str :index strEnd = str index+1: strChar = str index htmlColor = htmlColor.format(Color=color, Letter=strChar) strFinal = strStart+htmlColor+strEnd return strFinal. Hi all. I'm building a simple device for my lab which actually captures images at specific intervals. Here (https://imgur.com/a/K4dSI3r) is a sequence of images for example. amp#x200B; So while scrolling down, you will notice that the color of the liquid inside those tubes is changing. So what I wanna achieve is to programmatically calculate an index that corresponds to the difference between the liquid colors in the two cases. I've never before dealt with image analysis and thus I would. I am planning to start a clothing brand, our graphics designer who had no experience in fashion has asked for some specifications, 1.) File type/Format for printing \- What file type is the best for printing large designs with color onto shirts (e.g psd jpg) \-What resolution should this be? \-Index color separations? (not sure what this is) 2.) What printing methods are best for getting the tshirt design as similar to the original image? \- I have researched both screen printing(DTG. Does anyone here know the equation for the relationship between Color-Index and Effective Temperature? There are bunch of different ones online that all yield different answers but none from a really good source. My star has a B - V of 1.63 if that helps at all. amp#x200B; Edit: spelling. Also if you can give a source that would be wonderful. 
Been practicing ggplot, thought someone here might think this is at least somewhat interesting (and it didn't really seem to be something for r/dataisbeautiful) Link: https://imgur.com/a/ZQnK40X (https://imgur.com/a/ZQnK40X) Data were simulated (pretty much arbitrarily) to make a somewhat interesting shape that still looked kinda linear. Everything was done with the ggplot2 and animation packages in R. Edit (Source Code): Please let me know if you know a better way of doing something. I don't quite understand the logic here. Oculus are putting 1600 x 1440 OLED's in the Quest for 9. OLEDs are not super expensive as people seem to think (Samsung sell brand new budget smartphones for 0 with OLED screens). In fact, here are the IHS Market display cost indicators as of Q1 2019: 5.7" full-display 2880x1440 LCD: .39 5.7" 2560x1440 rigid OLED: .62 Flexible curved 5.8" 2880x1440 OLED: .61 The costs are similar. So why do we assume Index </p>
