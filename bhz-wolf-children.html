                            </header>
                            <p> Hello Reddit! I am Mamoru Hosoda, film director and co-founder of Studio Chizu ( an animation studio I started in 2011 with producer Yuichiro Saito. I recently finished my weekend at the Animation Is Film (https://AnimationIsFilm.com) Festival where my newest film Mirai (https://gkidstickets.com/us/mirai/?campaign=reddit) had its US Premiere. Mirai (https://gkidstickets.com/us/mirai/?campaign=reddit) will be released theatrically. 
So I just finished this movie last night and I absolutely loved it. It was stunningly beautiful and the most heartwarming portrayal of motherly love. Hana was without a doubt the best anime mother and one of the best mothers in general that I have ever seen. She was entirely devoted to giving her children a better life. She never once got angry with them or yelled at them even when they were being rowdy or misbehaving. Literally everything she did was to give her children a good life. If that's. Hello everyone, and once again, it's Mother's Day and it's time for the Wolf Children Rewatch! (https://78.media.tumblr.com/e08b95f78e28092dd950361095290002/tumblr_on3d60Lf0w1vd6rrvo1_500.gif) --- Discussion Question : What is one memory of your mother that has always stuck with you? --- Here is a link to last year's discussion (https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6b68mb/spoilers_mothers_day_rewatch_wolf_children/) if you want to see what we said then! For those who have seen the movie, did anyone else think that Souhei (Yuki's love interest) is secretly part wolf? I can't be the only one who thought that something about the way he acts just seems kind of . . . off, am I? For example, you know that scene where Yuki cuts his ear right? Well what did Souhei do right before that? He sniffed her, and then mentioned she smelled like a dog. Now who randomly sniffs people like that? It would make more sense if he also has canine instincts My god, this movie is undoubtedly a masterpiece in my heart, the story of Hana and her two children Yuki and Ame, struggling to find their role in society as they grow up to become wolf and human after the death of their husband is something ill never forget. This movie has teached me a valuable lesson, and that is to always smile when facing big challenges in life because over time you'll be able to overcome them. If you haven't seen this movie watch it, you are not going to regret. I'm planning to watch the movie with my mom, but I'm wondering if we should watch it subbed or dubbed. Our native language is spanish, and I don't think it's been dubbed to that, but perhaps she'd prefer to hear the voices in a language she can understand. Please tell me if any of the soundtrack changes on the dub, because then it'd be a big no. Also, if recomending subbed, do you have any preferences on which sub should we watch? Thank you all, I love you! EDIT: ofc please Friend recommend these , but they're asleep. Curious what y'all would recommend over these ? They all look interesting and can't exactly decide. Maybe the one that'll give the most "feels"? Thanks for recommending any of these. So let me preface by saying that I‚Äôve been on a slice of life tour and watched the aforementioned anime within the past week or so. Found out about anohana and thought I‚Äôd give it a try and binged the whole thing in half a day or so. Man I was not expecting to be hit like this. Like I thought ‚Äúah ok it won‚Äôt be that bad‚Äù given that Menma was already dead and in spirit form. But when all the secrets and love confessions came out from everyone, I was destroyed at the end. ‚ÄúMenma we found you‚Äù. 
Here are some examples that I have Scratched the surface of many different other recommendation sites and bits and pieces from foremen chatter (I think that's how it's spelled.). And these are the kind of obscure things I'm looking for. A Tree of Palme Green Legend Ran Night on The Galatic Railroad Gauche the Cellist A somewhat closely released Trilogy of Sinbad movies, the first one being called Sinbad: The Flying Princess and the Secret Island Catnapped! Animal Treasure Island. Wolf Children is such an underrated movie and i think it is rare for someone to say that it is better than Frozen, but it is. The Wolf children should have also won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature of 2014 and not Frozen. I have seen both movies, but nothing really tops The wolf children when it comes to so so much like, music, scenery, emotions etc. If anyone are wondering what the movie is about, it is about a young woman meeting a young man in the university and they later become. I've already seen The Place Promised In Our Early Days and The Girl Who Leapt Through. Hi guys! I wrote a short piece on how Maquia and Wolf Children explore motherhood. I'd appreciate any feedback, and would love to know if you enjoyed these movies as much as I did! https://blubbyweb.wordpress.com/2019/04/10/motherhood-maquia-vs-wolf-children/ (https://blubbyweb.wordpress.com/2019/04/10/motherhood-maquia-vs-wolf-children/). Which movie handled the modern day human woman X creature person love story better. Check it out, it's on Netflix Portugal so I assume most Europe got it aswell. Enjoy. This is my first project for my Motion Graphic class. I know it seems pretty basic for you advanced animators but I feel darn proud of it üò§ This assignment was to choose a professional poster and animate it (have to convey a message too). https://youtu.be/NElOFX0EGqc. Things I didn‚Äôt like about this movie 1) We were given no back story or any information about the ‚Äòwolf man‚Äô not even his name all we know is that he's a werewolf and he‚Äôs the only one of his kind. 2) She gets pregnant after literally having sex with a wolf (who didn‚Äôt even care to turn into his human form while doing it). 3) Wolf man leaves the house without anyone knowing and suddenly dies. 4) She didn‚Äôt vaccinate her children, they‚Äôre half human and she doesn‚Äôt even know if her husband. 
It is with great pleasure that I announce that renowned director Mamoru Hosoda (https://myanimelist.net/people/5067/Mamoru_Hosoda) will be here to do an AMA with our community. He is known for being the driving force behind titles such as The Girl Who Leapt Through Time , Summer Wars , Wolf Children , The Boy and the Beast , and upcoming film Mirai . He will have a period of time roughly between 4:30pm-5:30pm PST on Monday October 22nd (10/22) to answer any and all questions </p>
