                            <p> Hey /r/flightsim. Recently I began wondering about the future of flying simulators. FSX was released in 2006, with the last official addon released a year later. Now, even with various different plugins you still cannot achieve 2014-worthy graphic, not to mention the horrible performance of MS's sim. X-Plane, on the other hand, seems to be miles ahead of FSX, yet it lacks when it comes to the addons. Then there is FlightGear, which, although constantly improving, is not yet ready 
I'm very torn between the three, i am brand new to the vr scene and am a casual flight simulator player. I already own FSX and ive never had issues with it. My PC has i5 8600k rx580 and 16gb of ram amp#x200B; Which would would allow me smooth and fun gameplay, i intend on using the vr controls. Welcome to the self-promotion thread.

I am creating a 4-d flying simulator which incorporates oculus rift and physical stimulations(cold/hot air, some water, a platform). For this project I need a way to get the current persons Coordinates(can be x/y/z or lat\long). I need the coordinates to check if I'm in any pre-defined polygons where I will have an arduino turn on the a/c or water spray. I wanted to create this project using google earth VR, but it has no way to get the user's coordinates without building. Some of these flying islands/cities could even have runways. Hey guys. I was just wondering whether there has been any information about third-party accesories on the Oculus Quest? For example joysticks for flying simulators, steering wheel amp pedals for car simulators etc. I know it makes sense to support these with the Rift (S) on a beefy PC, but it would be nice to have the opportunity to connect accesories like this on the Quest. Hello /r/flying I have already posted this in r/flightsim and figured I would post this here as well to see if any of you have different suggestions. As the title says, I am a fixed wing student pilot IRL and looking to get into flight sims to supplement my flight training and prepare me for IFR training. I already have my PPL but have not been in the cockpit in almost 3 years and feel super rusty at the moment. I figured a flight sim might help the transition back into the cockpit (note Note: It's gonna be a long one So I've been around since the early days of VR. I owned the DK1, DK2, and now the Rift. From getting excited for the very first jank flying simulators, messing around google earth for far too long, and now to more polished titles. I've played an absolute ton of games, and have poured more money than I care to admit into my library. These are just my recommendations, so take them with a grain of salt. Also be sure to recommend any of your favorite games 
So I'm about halfway to getting my private pilot license, just about to start my cross countrys. I'd be interested to know which flight simulators (if any) are pretty realistic with use of the Leap Motion. Specifically a Cessna. Hi all, amp#x200B; I have a quick question for you guys. A friend of mine is selling his computer pretty cheap and i'm thinking of buying it (32gb ram 3000, rtx2080, 9600k and z390mb for 1000$, would be well over 2000$ new in my country). However, i know that he 'cheaped out' on the cpu cooler and got a hyper h412r cooler with a tdp of 100W for a 9600k. He only used the computer for a flying simulator that heavily uses a single core, so he overclocked it to 4,8 Ghz. Now i don't Hey everyone, first time posting here. I'm one of the Leaders at Centre VR in Bournemouth, primarily working at our new venue up in Richmond Gardens (Above Lidl and Wilko) Compared to our smaller centre in BH2, we have 12 standing stations that run Vive Pro headsets, along with an array of Racing and Flying simulators which run using Samsung Odyssey headsets. We've been busy since opening the new centre a month ago with lots of families and kids parties however we seem to be lacking in seriou. ACE COMBAT TWO BAYBEEEEE This fuckin game man. Probably my favorite game of all time. My dad picked this up for me the same time we got Star Wars Demolition from my last review. I played this countless times, beat it on every difficulty, shot down every enemy, and learned how to fly on a flight stick rather than just a controller. What a blast. OKAY FIRST OFF the gameplay: This is a flying simulator. Not for most people, but Ace Combat is a decently-known series, especially Considering joining again as a senior member, had to stop being a cadet mostly because of time a few years ago. I like doing stuff like paperwork (decently fast at typing and find it relaxing) and like everything about aircraft, from flying simulators to reading diagrams, blueprints, and studying aircraft. What kind of stuff do senior members get to do besides the stuff in the air? Also what are the uniform requirements? I know blues are an option and the sort of casual dress polo-slacks. </p>
